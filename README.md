# Project Description
`ZipCleaner.sh' enters a directory of the user's choosing and removes all the zip files from it.

# Using the Program

## Tested Environments
This program was tested on different computers, all of which were running Windows 11. 
The compatibility of this program with either versions of Windows and other operating systems (such as MacOS X) has not been tested. 
Please report any unknown errors to Nicholas Blits, whose contact information is provided in the Credits section of this README file.

## Configuring the Directory to Remove .zip Files From
Line #4 of `ZipCleaner.sh` uses a template string for the directory to be cleaned of .zip files.
In order to this program to run without encountering an error message, users should download the file, right click and choose to "Edit with Notepad". From there, please change the template string to the path you wish to have cleared of any and all .zip files.
After the path has been configured, the file `ZipCleaner.sh` can be double clicked to begin the program's execution.

## Warning
This project does not wait for any confirmation from the user [including deleting the directory with all the .zip files in it]. Please be careful about the path you choose to link this program to before executing it.
